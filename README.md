# apigee-opa-callout

This repo shows a sample of how to use the External Callout policy with [Open Policy Agent](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa) for Apigee X/hybrid.

## Description

OPA is a general purpose policy engine (aka Policy Decision Point). Apigee's gateway can act as a PEP (policy enforcement point). The common pattern is for Apigee it invoke OPA, let OPA make the allow/deny decision and Apigee enforce the decision.  

Apigee provides a policy called External Callout, which invokes an gRPC server that implements OPA. OPA provides golang [integration](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa) which is exposed as a gRPC service. In most cases, OPA provided HTTP API service/server is sufficient. This repo is mostly to show Apigee's External Callout policy with an example.

## Example

In this example, Apigee produces a JWT token that looks like:

```json
{
  "aud": "remote-service-client",
  "nbf": 1623366935,
  "developer_email": "apps@sample.com",
  "iss": "xxx",
  "exp": 1623367835,
  "iat": 1623366935,
  "jti": "a406abba-8f3c-434d-978b-d70d2dbf8d68"
}
```

Using Rego, a policy has been authored to grant access to HTTP Methods like this:

```
package httpapi.authz

import input

default allow = false

developers = {
    "apps@sample.com": {
        "/opa/items": {"GET"},
    },
}

allow {
    developers[input.developer_email][input.path][_] = input.method
}
```

This rego allows certain developers (the Apigee entities) access to certain methods. Normally, I would use built-in policies to check such permissions, but for this example we will use OPA.

The external callout service executes the input against the rule and sets a flow variable `opa-result` with the bool `true` or `false`

## Setup

Build and deploy the External callout service

```sh
skaffold run -p gcb --default-repo=gcr.io/xxx -f skaffold-apigee-opa.yaml
```

Deploy the API Proxy included [here](./apiproxy)
